# Uptored_Webpage

Hi!

This is a personal project Im working on to try to use my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP to build a webpage from scratch.

Im using this as well to learn how to use Github as this is my first Repo.

The webpage is build with HTML, CSS and a litlle bit of Javascript. I used PHP to create a contact form that connect to the hosting in order to save the data and work with webmail.

The webpage is live on a Godaddy Hosting plan with Cpanel. You can check it on uptored.com
